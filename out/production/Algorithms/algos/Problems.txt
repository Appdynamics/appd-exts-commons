1. Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented into a 
space-separated sequence of dictionary words. See following examples for more details.

2. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters What if you 
can not use additional data structures?

3. Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer 
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine An extra copy of the array is not

4.Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not

5.Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with �%20�

6. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, 
write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees Can you do this in place?

7. Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0

8. Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another 
Giventwostrings,s1ands2,writecodetocheckifs2isarotationofs1using only one call to isSubstring (i e , �waterbottle� is a rotation of �erbottlewat�)

9. Longest palindrome

10. Longest common subsequence

11. Number with max repetitions in an array

11. Substrings of a given string.

12. Longest common substring.

13. Permutations and anagrams of a string

14. Given an input of SXT matrix, find NXN magic squares. 

15. Implement a sudoku solver.

16. Combinations of a string.

17. Does a given file name match a single-star pattern? (can't use regex I assume) 
index.html matches *.html 
foo.txt does not match *.html 

18. Find O(n) solution for all subsets of an array.
[1,2,3,4] = {

[1],
[1,2],
[2],
and so on
} 


matches(�index.html�, �*html�) returns true 
matches(�foo.txt�, �*html�) returns false 
matches(�cat�, �c*t�) returns true



19. Given a set of intervals, merge overlapping intervals
      i/p [1,3] [2,6],[8,10],[15,18]

      o/p: [1,6] [8,10] [15,18]


20. There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
    Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase.
    The order of the steps matters.

    For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

    1, 1, 1, 1
    2, 1, 1
    1, 2, 1
    1, 1, 2
    2, 2
    What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.




 21. Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.

     For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], the longest increasing subsequence has length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.
